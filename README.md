# AuraCast

 Auracast is a multisensory network monitoring tool built to reduce cognitive load in security analysts by transforming network data into **procedural music**, **ambient lighting**, and **visual alerts**.

Sound weird? Good. It is. 

Built for anomaly detection. Powered by the warp.

## Features

- ðŸŽµ **Sonification** of network events using real-time procedural music
- ðŸ’¡ **Ambient lighting** via Philips Hue to indicate alert severity
- ðŸ“œ Suricata **alert ingestion** via JSON
- ðŸ§± **Modular adapters** for UI, console, and audio/visual feedback
- ðŸ§  Built to explore human perception in threat detection

## How to Run

Will come up with something later.

## Project Notes

The tool is a proof of concept (PoC), and can therefore be unstable.

**THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL TOOL BEST RUN IN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS**
